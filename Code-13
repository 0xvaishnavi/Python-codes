#Python program to calculate the total marks, percentage and grade of a student.Marks obtained in each of the three subjects entered by the user.Assign grades according to the following criteria: Grade A: if Percentage >= 80 Grade B: if Percentage >= 60 and Percentage < 80 Grade C: if Percentage >= 40 and Percentage < 60 Grade D: if Percentage < 40

print("Note:- Please enter marks obtained out of 100 ")
a=int(input("Enter the grade of the student in Subject I here:- "))
b=int(input("Enter the grade of the student in Subject II here:- "))
c=int(input("Enter the grade of the student in Subject III here:- "))
total=a+b+c
print("The total marks obtained are", total,"out of 300!")
percen=(total/300)*100
print("The percentage of the student is:- ", round(percen,2), "%")
if  percen >= 80:
    grade = 'A'
elif  percen >= 60:
    grade = 'B'
elif  percen >= 40:
    grade = 'C'
