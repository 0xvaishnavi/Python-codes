Python program to find the minimum and maximum of the numbers entered by the user. As soon as the user enters a ‘-999’, stop taking in any further input from user and display the minimum and maximum. 

minn = float('inf')
maxn = float('-inf') 

while True:
    num = float(input("Enter a number (enter -999 to stop): "))
    
    if num == -999:
        break
    
    if num < minn:
        minn = num
    if num > maxn:
        maxn = num
        
if minn != float('inf') and maxn != float('-inf'):
    print(f"Minimum number: {minn}")
    print(f"Maximum number: {maxn}")
else:
    print("No numbers were entered.")
