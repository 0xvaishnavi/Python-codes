Python program to find a particular element out of the numbers entered by the user. As soon as the user enters a ‘-999’, stop taking in any further input from user and display the minimum and maximum. 

minn, maxn = float('inf'), float('-inf')
while True:
    num = float(input("Enter a number (enter -999 to stop): "))
    if num == -999:
        break
    minn, maxn = min(minn, num), max(maxn, num)
if minn != float('inf') and maxn != float('-inf'):
    print(f"Minimum: {minn}, Maximum: {maxn}")
else:
    print("No numbers were entered.")
