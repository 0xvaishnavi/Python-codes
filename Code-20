Python program to print the following conversion table (using Loop constructs):
Height (in Feet)	Height (in Inches)
5.0 ft	          60 inches
5.1 ft	          61.2 inches
….	….
6.0 ft	          72 inches

a=5.0
b=6.0
c=0.1
print("Height (in feet) \t Height (in inches)")
for i in range(int((b-a)/c)+1):
    height=a+(i*c)
    inches=height*12
    print(height,"ft\t\t\t",round(inches,2),"inches")
